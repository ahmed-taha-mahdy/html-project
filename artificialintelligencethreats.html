   <h2>Economic threats</h2>
    These technologies will affect the size and quality of jobs and job opportunities available, as the robot is expected to negatively affect jobs in the manufacturing industries, the automotive and electrical industries, in addition to customer service.
   
   <h2>Social threats</h2>
    The increase in dealing with machines leads to the gradual separation of humans from their human social surroundings, which loses human relations their traditional flexibility, and makes them more solid and rigid. Thus, ways of thinking and human interactions turn from useful complexity, to profiling, even if it is productive, and the goal of human relations becomes material after it was Basically moral.

    <h2>security threats</h2>
    One of the dangerous repercussions posed by artificial intelligence technologies is the threat of these technologies to the human right to life, and this is evident in the case of autonomous combat systems such as drones that carry weapons, or existing combat robots, where the danger here lies in the fact that these devices are designed primarily for destruction, so what If it falls into the wrong hands, or is hacked as a result of human failure or error in security procedures and the algorithms that control it have been tampered with, then the results will be catastrophic. 
 
    <h2>On the other side</h2>
    from my point of view i am believe that these damages will not happen and that the benefits of artificial intelligence are great and that it is a big and important event in the modern world and there are also some experts who have the same belief and the same point of view as mine
